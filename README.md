# ðŸ”Ž Log Viewer

`As an administrator of a Ruby on Rails based website, I can browse and search through my log files to examine customer browsing patterns or debug an issue.`

Log Viewer features a fully working API (using TypeScript, NodeJS, and NestJS), frontend (using Ember.js), and database (using PostgreSQL). One of my main goals was also to make setting up the stack as easy as possible, so I Dockerized the API as much as I could.

## Features

* Swagger documentation and UI setup
* Unit tests where appropriate
* Fuzzy search over logs
* Filter by HTTP Method types
* Various sort options
* Pagination

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (v18.06.0+)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v10+)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)

## Installation

* `npm install -g ember-cli@2.18.2` (installs ember-cli)
* `cd log-viewer-frontend && npm install`

## Running / Development

### API
* `cd log-viewer-api/`
* `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build`
  * This might take a while as it will need to download a PostgreSQL image and Node image and then build the image.
  * Upon startup, the API also 1) truncates the `logs` table in Postgres and then 2) seeds the `logs` table from the `sample.log` file (just to get a clean start every time)
  * Once it completes go to [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api). If it succeded, it you should be at the Swagger UI which lists all the endpoints, params, and even allows you to hit the API.
  
### Frontend
* `cd ../log-viewer-frontend/`
* `ember serve`
  * Assuming all `node_modules` were built properly, you should get a green `Build successful` message
* Visit app at [http://localhost:4200/log-viewer](http://localhost:4200/log-viewer).

## Notes/TODOs

* Certain parts of the code were not unit tested as they were more appropriately tested with e2e tests. Due to time constraints, I forewent implementing e2e tests
* The majority of my time was spent on the API as I didn't want the UI to drive the API design
* NestJS was still somewhat new to me, so a lot of my time was spent learning the framework, but definitely the right call!
* Dockerizing for local development (transpiling, hot reloading, running in a container, etc.) is also supported and that also took up a ton of time (TypeScript also makes everything a little more tricky). I provided no docs on there, but feel free to poke at the `docker-compose.yml` files, the `.vscode` folder, and of course the `Dockerfile`.
